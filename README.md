This is an example Pytorch Project!

I am now starting to follow the course...

I have now installed Pytorch, locally, within my repo using pip. 
// pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

// I have also updated my PATH environment variables within Windows, as highlighted by pip during installation of Pytorch. 
// This has cleared up errors with calling attributes of Pytorch in code.
